##### The Archival Project
The DA Archival project is an initiative to store
and digitize old documents, books, and notes from
physical documents. None of the code stored in the
archives is intended to run but rather to be read and
analyzed by curious bees. Please avoid putting build steps
or other files normally used in production unless it's
for educational purposes.
